*** Dependencies and Libraries ***

Note that Poseidon depends on Firmament
(https://github.com/camsas/firmament/), which is also Apache-licensed.
However, the "cs2" min-cost, max-flow solver coming with Firmament is
only available under a non-free license that does not permit commercial
use (see LICENSE file for Firmament).

If you intend to use Firmament in a commercial production environment, we
recommend that you use our free, BSD-licensed Flowlessly solver instead
(https://github.com/ICGog/Flowlessly).
